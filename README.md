### Even in today's world, more than 15% infants miss their vaccines and are vulnerable to deadly diseases. Skipping the vaccination is majorly caused by parents forgetting to get their babies vaccinated at the right time.

- Our solution aims at targeting each family using their **Bhamashah ID**, making sure the parents get a reminder of any upcoming vaccination schedule.

- Being **bilingual (Hindi and English)** makes it easy to use for almost every citizen of Rajasthan. The Intuitive and simple UI adds to the accessibility.

- The app also **removes the burden of updating the records from the parents to the PHC staff**, ensuring the records are maintained properly.

- Such implementation also helps the state **get an insight of the needs of people at a granular level**, like which vaccine would be in maximum demand in the coming month.

- We believe, our solution if comes to practice, would make the life of millions of kids safer than ever.
